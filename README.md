# Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) Module Documentation

## 1. Introduction
The Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) is a fundamental component in digital systems, particularly in processors, responsible for performing arithmetic and logical operations. This document describes a 4-bit ALU implemented in Verilog, a hardware description language used for designing and modeling digital circuits. The ALU supports basic operations such as addition, subtraction, bitwise AND, OR, and NOT, selected via a 3-bit operation code.

## 2. Module Overview
The `alu` module is a combinational logic block that processes two 4-bit inputs and produces a 4-bit output based on the selected operation. It is designed for simplicity and efficiency, making it suitable for integration into larger digital systems like microprocessors or custom digital circuits.

### 2.1 Module Declaration
```verilog
module alu (
    input [3:0] A, B,    // 4-bit inputs
    input [2:0] op,      // 3-bit operation code
    output reg [3:0] Y   // 4-bit output
);
```

### 2.2 Port Description
- **Inputs**:
  - `A [3:0]`: A 4-bit operand (e.g., `4'b1010` for decimal 10).
  - `B [3:0]`: A second 4-bit operand (e.g., `4'b0011` for decimal 3).
  - `op [2:0]`: A 3-bit operation code that determines the operation to perform.
- **Output**:
  - `Y [3:0]`: A 4-bit result of the selected operation, implemented as a register (`reg`) for use in the procedural block.

## 3. Functional Description
The ALU performs one of five operations based on the 3-bit `op` input, with a default case for undefined operation codes. The operations are implemented in a combinational manner using an `always @(*)` block, ensuring the output updates immediately when inputs change.

### 3.1 Operation Table
The following table summarizes the operations supported by the ALU:

| Operation Code (`op`) | Operation       | Description                     |
|-----------------------|-----------------|---------------------------------|
| `3'b000`             | Addition        | `Y = A + B`                    |
| `3'b001`             | Subtraction     | `Y = A - B`                    |
| `3'b010`             | Bitwise AND     | `Y = A & B`                    |
| `3'b011`             | Bitwise OR      | `Y = A | B`                    |
| `3'b100`             | Bitwise NOT     | `Y = ~A` (ignores `B`)         |
| Others (`3'b101`, `3'b110`, `3'b111`) | Zero Output | `Y = 4'b0000`         |

### 3.2 Operation Details
- **Addition (`op = 3'b000`)**:
  - Computes the 4-bit sum of `A` and `B`.
  - Example: If `A = 4'b0011` (3) and `B = 4'b0100` (4), then `Y = 4'b0111` (7).
  - Note: Overflow is not detected (e.g., `4'b1111 + 4'b0001` wraps around to `4'b0000`).
- **Subtraction (`op = 3'b001`)**:
  - Computes `A - B`.
  - Example: If `A = 4'b0100` (4) and `B = 4'b0011` (3), then `Y = 4'b0001` (1).
  - Negative results may produce underflow (e.g., `4'b0000 - 4'b0001 = 4'b1111`, interpreted as unsigned).
- **Bitwise AND (`op = 3'b010`)**:
  - Performs a bitwise AND operation on `A` and `B`.
  - Example: If `A = 4'b1010` and `B = 4'b1100`, then `Y = 4'b1000`.
- **Bitwise OR (`op = 3'b011`)**:
  - Performs a bitwise OR operation on `A` and `B`.
  - Example: If `A = 4'b1010` and `B = 4'b1100`, then `Y = 4'b1110`.
- **Bitwise NOT (`op = 3'b100`)**:
  - Computes the bitwise NOT of `A`, ignoring `B`.
  - Example: If `A = 4'b1010`, then `Y = 4'b0101`.
- **Default Case**:
  - For undefined `op` codes (`3'b101`, `3'b110`, `3'b111`), the output is set to `4'b0000`.
  - This ensures predictable behavior for invalid inputs.

## 4. Implementation Details
The ALU is implemented using a single `always @(*)` block, which creates combinational logic. The output `Y` is declared as a `reg` type because it is assigned within a procedural block, but the logic is purely combinational (no sequential elements like flip-flops).

### 4.1 Verilog Code
```verilog
always @(*) begin
    if (op == 3'b000) Y = A + B;  // Add A + B
    else if (op == 3'b001) Y = A - B;  // Subtract A - B
    else if (op == 3'b010) Y = A & B;  // AND A and B
    else if (op == 3'b011) Y = A | B;  // OR A or B
    else if (op == 3'b100) Y = ~A;     // NOT A
    else Y = 4'b0000;                  // Output 0 for other codes
end
endmodule
```

### 4.2 Design Considerations
- **Combinational Logic**: The use of `always @(*)` ensures the ALU responds immediately to input changes, suitable for real-time processing in a processorâ€™s datapath.
- **Compact Operation Set**: The ALU supports a minimal set of operations to keep the design simple, reducing resource usage in FPGA or ASIC implementations.
- **No Status Flags**: The design omits flags (e.g., carry, overflow, zero) to maintain simplicity, but this limits its use in applications requiring condition codes.
- **Unsigned Arithmetic**: The ALU treats inputs as unsigned 4-bit numbers, which simplifies the logic but restricts applicability for signed operations.

## 5. Usage
The ALU can be instantiated in a larger Verilog design, such as a CPU, microcontroller, or custom digital circuit. It is typically used in the execute stage of a processor pipeline to perform arithmetic or logical operations on register values.

### 5.1 Example Instantiation
```verilog
module top (
    input [3:0] input_a, input_b,
    input [2:0] operation,
    output [3:0] result
);
    alu my_alu (
        .A(input_a),
        .B(input_b),
        .op(operation),
        .Y(result)
    );
endmodule
```

In this example, the ALU is instantiated in a top-level module, connecting external inputs to `A`, `B`, and `op`, with the output `Y` driving the `result` wire.

## 6. Testing and Verification
To ensure the ALU functions correctly, a comprehensive testbench is recommended. The testbench should:
1. Test all operations (`op = 3'b000` to `3'b100`) with various input combinations for `A` and `B`.
2. Include edge cases, such as:
   - Maximum values (`A = 4'b1111`, `B = 4'b1111`).
   - Zero inputs (`A = 4'b0000`, `B = 4'b0000`).
   - Mixed values (e.g., `A = 4'b1010`, `B = 4'b0101`).
3. Verify invalid `op` codes produce `Y = 4'b0000`.
4. Check for correct handling of arithmetic wraparound (e.g., addition overflow).

### 6.1 Example Testbench
```verilog
module alu_tb;
    reg [3:0] A, B;
    reg [2:0] op;
    wire [3:0] Y;

    alu dut (.A(A), .B(B), .op(op), .Y(Y));

    initial begin
        $monitor("A=%b, B=%b, op=%b, Y=%b", A, B, op, Y);
        // Test addition
        A = 4'b0011; B = 4'b0100; op = 3'b000; #10;
        // Test subtraction
        A = 4'b0100; B = 4'b0011; op = 3'b001; #10;
        // Test AND
        A = 4'b1010; B = 4'b1100; op = 3'b010; #10;
        // Test OR
        A = 4'b1010; B = 4'b1100; op = 3'b011; #10;
        // Test NOT
        A = 4'b1010; B = 4'bxxxx; op = 3'b100; #10;
        // Test invalid op
        A = 4'b1010; B = 4'b1100; op = 3'b111; #10;
        $finish;
    end
endmodule
```

This testbench monitors inputs and outputs, applies test cases, and simulates the ALUâ€™s behavior over time.

## 7. Limitations
The ALU has the following constraints:
- **Bit Width**: Limited to 4-bit operands and results, which restricts its use for larger data.
- **No Status Flags**: Lacks outputs for carry, overflow, or zero, which are common in processor ALUs.
- **Unsigned Operations**: Does not support signed arithmetic, limiting its use in applications requiring negative numbers.
- **Limited Operation Set**: Only supports five operations, excluding common operations like XOR, shift, or multiplication.
- **No Error Handling**: Invalid `op` codes default to `4'b0000` without signaling an error.

## 8. Potential Extensions
To enhance the ALUâ€™s functionality, consider the following:
- **Add Status Flags**: Include outputs for carry (for addition), borrow (for subtraction), zero (when `Y = 0`), and overflow.
- **Support Signed Arithmetic**: Modify addition and subtraction to handle twoâ€™s complement numbers.
- **Expand Operations**: Add support for XOR (`A ^ B`), left/right shifts, or comparison operations.
- **Increase Bit Width**: Extend to 8-bit, 16-bit, or 32-bit operands for broader applicability.
- **Pipelining**: Add registers to make the ALU sequential for use in pipelined architectures.

## 9. Applications
The ALU can be used in:
- **Microprocessors**: As the core computational unit in a CPUâ€™s datapath.
- **Digital Signal Processing**: For basic arithmetic operations in signal processing circuits.
- **Educational Projects**: To teach digital design and Verilog programming.
- **Custom Circuits**: In ASICs or FPGAs requiring simple arithmetic/logical operations.

## 10. Synthesis Considerations
When synthesizing the ALU for FPGA or ASIC:
- **Resource Usage**: The design is lightweight, using minimal logic gates due to its simple operation set.
- **Timing**: As combinational logic, the critical path depends on the longest operation (typically addition or subtraction).
- **Optimization**: Synthesis tools may optimize the `if-else` structure into a multiplexer-based design for efficiency.

## 11. Conclusion
This 4-bit ALU is a simple, efficient Verilog module suitable for basic arithmetic and logical operations. Its combinational design ensures fast response to input changes, and its minimal operation set makes it resource-efficient. While limited in scope, it serves as a foundation for more complex ALUs and can be extended with additional features as needed. Comprehensive testing is recommended to verify functionality across all input combinations and operation codes.

##TASK IV:--
Hereâ€™s a simple, easy-to-understand documentation for the **FIR filter Verilog code** and testbench youâ€™ve seen earlier. This is written with clarity in mind for students or beginners in digital design.

---

#  FIR Filter in Verilog â€“ Documentation

---

##  What is a FIR Filter?

A **Finite Impulse Response (FIR)** filter is a type of digital filter where the output depends only on current and past input values. It does **not** use previous output values.

---

## Design Specifications

* **Filter Type**: Low-pass
* **Number of Taps**: 5 (this means we use 5 recent input values)
* **Coefficients** (weights applied to input values):

```
h[0] = 1
h[1] = 2
h[2] = 3
h[3] = 2
h[4] = 1
```

These weights are symmetric and give a smoothing effect.

---

## Verilog Module: `fir_filter`

### Inputs:

| Name | Width  | Description                         |
| ---- | ------ | ----------------------------------- |
| clk  | 1 bit  | System clock                        |
| rst  | 1 bit  | Synchronous reset (clears memory)   |
| x    | 8 bits | Input sample (new data every clock) |

### Output:

| Name | Width   | Description                    |
| ---- | ------- | ------------------------------ |
| y    | 16 bits | Output result (filtered value) |

---

### How It Works (Step-by-Step):

1. **Shift Register**: Stores last 5 inputs (like a conveyor belt).
2. **Multiply** each input by its corresponding coefficient.
3. **Sum** all the products to get the output.
4. This process repeats every clock cycle.

---

### Code Behavior:

```verilog
shift_reg[0] <= x;
shift_reg[1] <= shift_reg[0];
...
```

* New input goes into the first position.
* Previous inputs move forward in the register.

```verilog
y <= h[0]*shift_reg[0] + h[1]*shift_reg[1] + ... + h[4]*shift_reg[4];
```

* Output is calculated as a sum of products.

---

## Testbench: `tb_fir_filter`

### Purpose:

To simulate and observe how the filter reacts to a series of input values.

### Steps:

* A clock toggles every 5 time units.
* A series of input samples (from 10 to 255) are sent in.
* The module filters the input, and we can observe the output.

---

### Sample Simulation Timing:

| Clock Cycle | Input (x) | Output (y)              |
| ----------- | --------- | ----------------------- |
| 1           | 10        | 10 (start of filtering) |
| 2           | 20        | 10 + 2Ã—20               |
| 3           | 30        | 10 + 2Ã—20 + 3Ã—30        |
| ...         | ...       | Filter stabilizes       |

---

## Performance Summary

| Aspect       | Value / Comment                     |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| Filter Type  | Low-pass FIR                        |
| Taps         | 5 inputs used                       |
| Latency      | 4 cycles (delay until valid output) |
| Resource Use | 5 multipliers, 4 adders             |
| Output Width | 16 bits to handle large sums        |

---

## Real-World Use

FIR filters are used in:

* Audio processing (bass/treble filtering)
* Signal noise reduction
* Communication systems (channel equalization)

---

## Summary

* This FIR filter is **easy to understand**, **lightweight**, and suitable for FPGAs or beginner projects.
* You can **change the coefficients** to make different kinds of filters: low-pass, high-pass, band-pass, etc.
* Itâ€™s easy to extend this design by increasing the number of taps.

  ##TASK III:- 4-STAGE PROCESSOR DESIGN
  Here's a clear and beginner-friendly **documentation** of your Verilog module `pipelined_processor`, which implements a simple 4-stage pipelined processor supporting `ADD`, `SUB`, and `LOAD` instructions.

---

# Verilog Documentation â€“ 4-Stage Pipelined Processor

---

##  Overview

This module is a simplified **4-stage pipelined processor**, which mimics the instruction flow found in modern CPUs. It supports basic operations:

* `ADD`: Add two registers
* `SUB`: Subtract two registers
* `LOAD`: Load data from memory

---

##  Inputs

| Signal | Width | Description         |
| ------ | ----- | ------------------- |
| `clk`  | 1-bit | Clock signal        |
| `rst`  | 1-bit | Reset signal (sync) |

---

##  Processor Stages

This processor breaks the instruction flow into 4 classic pipeline stages:

### 1. **Instruction Fetch (IF)**

* Fetches the instruction from `instruction_memory` using the `pc` (Program Counter).
* Computes `pc + 4` to get the next instruction address.

```verilog
if_id_instruction <= instruction_memory[pc[9:2]];
if_id_pc_plus_4 <= pc + 4;
```

---

### 2. **Instruction Decode (ID)**

* Extracts instruction fields:

  * `opcode` â€“ operation code (e.g. ADD, SUB)
  * `rs_addr`, `rt_addr`, `rd_addr` â€“ register addresses
* Reads values from the `register_file`.
* Sets control signals (`alu_op`, `reg_write`, `mem_read`) based on the instruction type.

```verilog
id_ex_rs_data <= register_file[rs_addr];
id_ex_rt_data <= register_file[rt_addr];
```

---

### 3. **Execute (EX)**

* Performs the operation defined by `alu_op`:

  * `00`: ADD
  * `01`: SUB
  * `10`: LOAD (address only; no operation)
* Passes the result to the WB stage.

```verilog
alu_result <= id_ex_rs_data + id_ex_rt_data; // Example for ADD
```

---

### 4. **Write Back (WB)**

* Writes result back to the register file:

  * If `mem_read` is 1 â†’ write memory data
  * Otherwise â†’ write ALU result
* Uses `ex_wb_rd_addr` to choose destination register.

```verilog
register_file[ex_wb_rd_addr] <= wb_result;
```

---

##  Memory Components

* **Instruction Memory**: Stores program instructions.

```verilog
instruction_memory[0] = 32'h00410183; // ADD R3, R2, R1
```

* **Data Memory**: Stores data accessed by LOAD instructions.

```verilog
data_memory[0] = 32'h0000000A;
```

* **Register File**: Stores general-purpose registers R0 to R31.

```verilog
register_file[rd] <= wb_result;
```

---

## ðŸ›  Sample Instructions (in memory)

| Instruction      | Opcode (binary) | Function      |
| ---------------- | --------------- | ------------- |
| `ADD R3, R2, R1` | `000001`        | R3 = R2 + R1  |
| `SUB R4, R5, R2` | `000010`        | R4 = R5 - R2  |
| `LOAD R6, [R3]`  | `000011`        | R6 = Mem\[R3] |

---

##  How It Works (Step-by-Step Execution)

1. The instruction is fetched and passed to the next stage.
2. Registers are read and control signals are set.
3. Arithmetic or memory address is computed.
4. The result is written back to a register.

This flows in a pipeline where each stage works in parallel on different instructions â€” like an assembly line.

---

##  Simulation Ideas

To test the processor, create a **testbench** that:

* Initializes register values.
* Steps through several clock cycles.
* Monitors values of `pc`, `register_file`, and pipeline registers.

---

##  Performance Analysis

| Metric          | Comment                                     |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Pipeline Depth  | 4 stages (IF, ID, EX, WB)                   |
| Instruction Set | Very limited (ADD, SUB, LOAD)               |
| Memory Access   | Only LOAD, no STORE instruction implemented |
| Hazards         | No hazard detection implemented             |
| Clock Cycles    | Takes 4+ cycles to produce valid output     |

---

##  Extension Ideas

* Add more instructions (STORE, BRANCH).
* Implement hazard detection (forwarding, stalls).
* Add data cache or memory controller.
